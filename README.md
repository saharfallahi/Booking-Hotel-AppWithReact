# Booking Hotel App


The Booking Hotel App project is a hotel booking application that has the ability to search among hotels based on the hotel name and city, date of stay, and number of rooms required.
In this project, the react-leaflet package is used to display and manage locations, and by displaying the location of hotels on the map, it is possible to add to favorites locations, and with Bookmarks, favorite locations can be reached.
To implement the backend of this project, JSON Server is used, and hotel information is placed in the db.json file
